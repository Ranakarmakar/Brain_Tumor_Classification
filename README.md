Medical imaging is the technique and process of creating visual representations
of the interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention, as well as visual
representation of the function of some organs or tissues. Medical imaging seeks to
reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones, as well as to diagnose and
treat disease. Medical imaging also establishes a database of
normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities.
